# goal-app
New Year, new app. This app will have a list of personal goals I want to achieve in 2019.

It will become a part of a larger application I'm currently working on.

*To run locally:*

1. Clone repo
2. "npm install" (see * if fails)
3. "npm start"
4. Open "localhost:3000" in browser.

*Node.js needs to be in version 10 to install node-sass 4.

Type "node -v" in terminal to check your current version.
